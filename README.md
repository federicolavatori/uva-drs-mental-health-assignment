# Digital Research Seminar - Group Making and Digital Culture

## Objective and Research Questions
The objective of the research project is to investigate how anxiety issues are treated on Instagram.

To what extent can we split accounts into professionals
and non-professionals when it comes to talking about anxiety issues?

What are the visual signals as well as the linguistic traits that set apart the experts from
the non-officially qualified accounts?

## Evironment
Make sure you prepare a local environment in python with poetry.

## Data Preparation
Istagram posts data with #anxiety scraped through [Zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer) + [4CAT](https://4cat.nl/) 

## Data Analysis
A combination of techniques has been applied to the dataset:
