    "# Topic Model Creation and Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will train a set of topic models. You must have a dictionary file (extension: .lda_dict) and a corpus in matrix market format (extension: .mm). If you do not have these files, the script will fail. Use the Preparation Notebook to create these files. If you do not have docbins, create them in the Corpus Linguistics notebook before using the Preparation Notebook for Topic Modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling has been introduced in class and you can read more about it in our readings (particularly Nelson, Lukito and Pruden, and Ganesh and Faggiani). \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to decide how many topics you want the model to give you. So for example, if you ask for 5 topics, that's how many you will get. If you ask for 50, that's how many you will get. We call this number of topics \"k\", which is our variable. We will refer to \"k\" very often--remember, that just means the number of topics!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should select at least 3 k values, eg. 5, 10, 15, which is what we will do here just for the sake of demonstration. You should then evaluate each model using the visualization you will find in each folder (discussed in class) to evaluate the topic model. If you are satisfied with it, then you can use that model, and in the following notebook, we will transform your original dataset with topic probabilities. First, of course, we have to train the models and inspect them. The files you need to do that are included here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each run (so for each k value you choose), this notebook may need to run for a long time. If this is taking an extremely long time on your computer, please contact me and I can run the computation for you (as this is a hardware limitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, set up your variables so the script knows where to look. This is similar to the Preparation notebook."
